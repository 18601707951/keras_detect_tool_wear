# PHM prediction by residual conventional neural network

This is a program for predicting RUL estimation for a high-speed CNC milling machine cutters, you can download data from [https://www.phmsociety.org/competition/phm/10](https://www.phmsociety.org/competition/phm/10) and run it to predict RUL.

# notice

This program are under development.

# recent achivement

+ By using wavelet transformation, loss (MSE) has been down to 9.0.

# dependency

+ Tensorflow / Theano / CNTK
+ Keras
